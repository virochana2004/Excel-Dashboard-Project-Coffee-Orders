It provides insights into total sales, top-performing products, customer preferences, and geographic distribution. Additionally, a new Coffee Profit Dashboard offers profit-focused insights, helping businesses assess profitability alongside sales data.

🔧 **Additional Customizations**

While the referenced YouTube video guided the creation of the initial Sales Dashboard, I made several enhancements to tailor it further:

* **Top 5 Cities**: Replaced "Top 5 Customers" with a "Top 5 Cities" metric in the Sales Dashboard for more relevant geographic insights.
* **Coffee Profit Dashboard**: Designed an additional dashboard focused on profit, which mirrors the structure of the Sales Dashboard but provides profit-based metrics instead of sales.
